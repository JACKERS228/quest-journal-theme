# Quest Journal Theme
A simple, lightweight theme for Obsidian inspired by quest journals. Whether you're doing a D&D campaign or recording your life's adventures, Quest Journal Theme immerses you in that adventurous spirit.

# Overview

Quest Journal transforms your Obsidian vault into an artifact from a fantasy world. It abandons the sterile look of modern note-taking apps in favor of warm parchment, aged leather, and typography that evokes the feeling of hand-written chronicles.Designed for Dungeon Masters, players, world-builders, and anyone who wants their notes to feel like part of a greater story.
# Key Features
* **Atmospheric Design**
* **Dual Aesthetics**: 
    * *Light Mode (Parchment)*: Warm, beige tones with rust-red accents, simulating ink on aged paper.
    * *Dark Mode (Ancient Leather)*: Deep browns and muted golds, evoking a leather-bound tome read by candlelight.
* **Tactile Texture**: Subtle paper grain texture overlay adds depth to the reading experience (customizable).
* **Immersive Typography**: Uses Cinzel for majestic, small-caps headers and Crimson Text for highly readable, serif body text.
* **RPG-Focused UIJournal-Style Layout**: Content is centered with a comfortable reading width, mimicking the pages of a book.
